 * The first thread handles the connection part. That is,
 * it will wait and accept for new connections. Once a
 * connexion is accepted, the client will sends its data.
 * Once this step is done, the thread will transfer this data
 * to the concurrent queue to the second thread.
 * (see launch_monitoring function below)
 *
 * This second thread will thus dequeue an item of the concurrent
 * queue. Then, according to the type of data, the general state
 * is updated (see above monit_state_t structure).
 * see processing_data below.
 *
 *
 * To achieve this such task a lot of things are done :
 *     1. initialize the concurrent queue used by both threads
 *     2. create the thread for the connection part
 *     3. create the thread for the data handling part
 *     4. set these to thread in detached state
 *
 * @return 1 if operation succeed
 *         0 otherwise ( - unable to launch threads )
